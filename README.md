## Habit Tracker

### Features

1. Add a habit:
   * Create a "+" icon or a "Add a new habit" button on the habit listing/ landing page which will open a dialog box kind of component with different text boxes for the details of the habit.
   * These text boxes will ask for the details, like the Name of the habit, the Goal of the habits, How many times do you want to perform the habit & what would be the start date.

3. Habit Listing Page
   * User should be able to see the list all habits created on a habit listing/ landing page.

4. If user clicks on any particular habit, all details of that habit should be visible.

5. Edit/Delete/Archive a habit
   * Edit:
       * I can see an "edit" option to edit the details of the habit that were entered earlier.
   * Delete:
       * I can see a "trash" icon or "delete" button to delete the habits.
   * Archive:
       * I can see an archive button that would archive a habit and that habit would show up on the archive page and get removed from the landing page.
